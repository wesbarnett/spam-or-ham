# Spam or ham?

Example of using machine learning to classify emails as spam or not
spam.

Click on the Jupyter notebook to see the details of how the model was
created.

 I created a Flask app to go with it, located in the `flask`
folder, where new emails are predicted as either spam or ham.
Obviously in real life one won't copy and paste emails into a web
form. This just shows a how to use a classifier in a web application.
